   - **Air Quality in India:**
     - Scatter plots of PM2.5 values vs. cities, illustrating different cities' contributions to air pollution.
     - Analysis of PM10 values vs. cities, highlighting the difference between PM2.5 and PM10 values.
     - An interactive map of India displaying states at higher risk of pollution.
     - Display of various AQI categories with an interactive chart for city categorization.
     - Line charts depicting PM2.5 trends over time for user-selected cities.
   - **Global Air Pollution Analysis:**
     - An interactive global map illustrating AQI categories in different countries.
     - Listings of countries and their AQI categories.
     - An interactive geo-graph showcasing countries and their respective AQI values.
   - Technologies Used: Streamlit, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Missingno, Plotly.

3. **Waste Classification:**
   - Designed to raise awareness about resource conservation, focusing on the "3 Rs": Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle.
   - A waste classification model allows users to click a photo, predict the waste type, and provides interesting facts/videos on decomposition or waste-based businesses.
   - Encourages effective waste classification and contributes to climate change mitigation.
   - Technologies Used: Flask, Deep Learning (CNN, VGG16 Model, ANN), Keras, TensorFlow.

4. **Water Prediction:**
   - Utilizes a Kaggle dataset with input features like pH, hardness, and turbidity to determine water drinkability.
   - Addresses the challenge of finding safe drinking water in today's world.
   - Valuable for businesses aiming for sustainable development and governments monitoring water quality.
   - Follows a machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, scaling, normalization, and model training (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost).
   - Implements a voting classifier for final predictions.
   - Technologies Used: Flask, Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
